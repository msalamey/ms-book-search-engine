## Description
To create a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The homepage contains a search box for entering a book name. From there the user can review the search results, and save and delete books from their dashboard.  

## Actions Taken
* Utilized the Google Books API search engine to render results when searching for books. 
* Utilized Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
* Utilized authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API. 
* Utilized Heroku to deploy the live website.

    Was able to upload via heroku, but was not able to get heroku to launch successfully. Please run through local host to view functional website. BCS support could not figure out the heroku issue after 2 hours of zoom and messaging support.
