## Description
To create a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The homepage contains a search box for entering a book name. From there the user can review the search results, and save and delete books from their dashboard.  

## Actions Taken
* Utilized the Google Books API search engine to render results when searching for books. 
* Utilized Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
* Utilized authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API. 
* Utilized Heroku to deploy the live website.
